## Overview of the statistical analysis:

Our project's goal is to determine whether investing in the bike rental industry in a different city is worth it.Â  One of the key factors we need to look at is distance covered. We can make an accurate analysis of when the bikes are rented, how long they are rented for, and what the most popular times are to rent a bike if we know how long the journeys are in the month of August. 

## Resources:
Tableu, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas

## Results:

  - Men bike more frequently than women, however women tend to ride for a little bit longer.
  - The busiest day for bikers is Thursday.
  - Most bike excursions last five minutes or less.
  - Most of the volume is made up of men.
  - Weekly volume is primarily made up of male subscribers.
  - The center of the city is where the majority of riders are.
  - Women have a slightly higher peak trip duration at 6 mins.
